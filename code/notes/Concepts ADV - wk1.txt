SYSTEM CALLS INSIDE KERNEL
kernel is a software layer that provides you some basic functionalities to abstract the hardware

#include <stdio.h>
- stream/buffered I/O
- buffered I/O avoids this inefficiency by buffering the writes in a data buffer in user-space
- avoid kernel trips

> printf()
printf("%s is over %d years old.\n", NAME, AGE);


#include <stdlib.h>
> atoi

#include <unistd.h>

> write, read


#define CONSTANT_NAME 1
-> define constant values in code

#include "filename.c" -> architect files

write and printf -> printf allows any char and is higher level so uses a buffer system which is less computationally intensive, write is more as it talks to the kernel
